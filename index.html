          One of the most popular programming languages worldwide is JavaScript.
          It was first created by Netscape in the middle of the 1990s, and it is
          now the foundation of contemporary web development. JavaScript is a
          high-level, interpreted language that lets programmers make dynamic,
          interactive websites. JavaScript enhances user experience whether
          you're creating a basic website or a sophisticated web-based
          application.
          <br />A scripting language that runs directly in web browsers,
          JavaScript offers interactivity in contrast to HTML and CSS, which
          specify the structure and design of a webpage. It allows developers to
          create features like form validation, animations, dynamic content
          updates, and even complex web applications like social media platforms
          and e-commerce sites. JavaScript was first used exclusively for
          frontend development, but with the advent of Node.js, it became a
          full-stack development language.
